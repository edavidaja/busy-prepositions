## sent *by* connect

```{r}
library(blastula)
render_connect_email("blastula.Rmd") |>
  attach_connect_email(subject = "busy busy busy", attach_output = TRUE)
```

## sent from connect

but by me

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(gmailr)
test_email <-
  gm_mime() %>%
  gm_to("david@rstudio.com") %>%
  gm_from("david@posit.co") %>%
  gm_subject("if you try then you can fly") %>%
  gm_text_body("over the rainbow")

# If all is good with your draft, then you can send it
gm_send_message(test_email)
```
